This repository contains a ransomware simulation project developed as part of the **Santander Cybersecurity Bootcamp**.  
It demonstrates how ransomware encrypts and decrypts files using a combination of **RSA** and **AES** encryption methods.  
The goal is to understand cryptographic techniques and their potential misuse through hands-on learning.

## üõ°Ô∏è Project Overview

This project simulates the core behavior of a ransomware attack in a controlled, educational environment.  
It includes scripts for encrypting and decrypting files, showing how symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption can be used together.

- `encrypter.py`: Encrypts files using AES and wraps the AES key with RSA
- `decrypter.py`: Decrypts the AES key with RSA and restores original files

---

## üöÄ Features

- **RSA Key Generation**  
  Automatically creates RSA 2048-bit public/private key pairs.

- **AES-256 File Encryption**  
  Encrypts file contents with AES; the AES key is then encrypted using RSA.

- **Secure Decryption Process**  
  Decrypts the AES key with the private RSA key and uses it to recover file contents.

- **Directory Management**  
  Organizes original, encrypted, and decrypted files in dedicated folders.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Python package: `cryptography`

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Library**: [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)  
- **Encryption Methods**:
  - **AES-256** (CBC mode) for file content
  - **RSA-2048** for encrypting the AES key
